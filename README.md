# jFuzzyLogic simple application

This program demonstrate a solar tracking system with 2 DOF. This system gets the sensor data from 4 LDR sensors and control the motors to move the solar panel to the sun's direction

Sensor inputs (0 to 5v) coming from the same direction sensors (north-south and east-west) substitute each other to get the values between (-5v to 5v). Outputs are motor power outputs in Watts. 

This is an assignment of M.Sc in AI University of Moratuwa
